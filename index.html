    <p>Items, or as they are generally known, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). The 
        intensity of resources needed to implement these systems has raised doubts 
        from the financial point of view about the return on these investments, as well as their real strategic impact.</p><br>ERP systems were born of the evolution of companies’ information needs.
    <p>Initially, the appearance of MRP (Materials Requirements Planning), in the 1970s, allowed for the equation of problems to calculate production materials for the mix of products whose structures contained a large number of components. MRP systems evolved to MRPII (Manufacturing Resources Planning), that had wider coverage, allowing for the inclusion of planning of other aspects, such as Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) to allow management of other resources (equipment, labor, etc.) in addition to materials.</p>
        
    <p>The next step was to include various other aspects, in addition to the industrial module (MRPII), such as accounting, finance, commercialization, human resources, and engineering, among others. This new generation of systems was named “ERP Systems,” generically called Business Management Systems (Laurindo & Mesquita, 2000).</p>
        
    <p>The next evolution consisted of integrating IT into the various stages of the supply chain, at first via EDI and presently via B2B (business-to-business) e-commerce (Laurindo et al., 2002). This subject will be dealt with in the chapter on the New Economy.</p>
        
    <p>In its basic concept, ERP is an applications system that serves as the “backbone” for the entire company. It integrates management and business processes, providing a global view of the organization (Laurindo & Pessoa, 2001). It has the enormous benefit of providing the opportunity to have a single database, a single application and a unified interface throughout the company (Bingi et al., 1999).</p>
        
    <p>When systems are not integrated, information necessary for operations can be repeated within several systems, a fact that creates problems of lost, outdated, and conflicting information. In large organizations, this is a very sensitive problem. Integrating information systems has the built in advantage of broader inclusion of the different business functions, which increased the company’s overall performance. It also implicitly holds out the expectation that the ready-made system (although there can be customization) will be less expensive than an equally efficient and integrated system developed internally by a systems architect.</p>
        
    <p align="justify">When the company is transnational with affiliates spread over various countries on different continents, this advantage can be even more significant. There are also great advantages when, due to the nature of its business, a company has a centralizing bias, whether strategic or cultural. In this case, in addition to operational gains, there is the perspective of organizational gain from the homogenization of operational practices and management forms.</p>
        
    <p align="justify">On the other hand, in implanting an ERP, the company is implicitly acquiring a generic solution that has the best management practices built in from the point of view of software providers. In many cases, this means a more efficient way of working, but there are times when the company can lose important differentiating techniques that make it more competitive than its rivals. Therefore, one needs to analyze whether the business practices included in the ERP “package” coincide with the practices most appropriate to the particularities of the business of the client company.</p>
        
    <p>In the case of Apple Computer, for example, the differentiation of its product is so great and so clear that any homogenization of services resulting from implanting an ERP would not mean a loss of competitiveness in relation to competitors. However, for the majority of companies that produce microcomputers, this is not the scenario, since their differentiation lies much more in services and price than in the product itself. In these cases, implanting an ERP implies 
    the risk of a loss of differentiation (Davenport, 1998). Gains in efficiency are obscured by the loss of effectiveness.</p>
        
    <p>Thus the integration of information systems, which permits a more efficient flow of processes, does not necessarily result in the desired strategic alignment.</p>
    
        <h1>Routes to a Strategic Role for IT</h1>
        
        <h2><strong>The Debate about IT Strategic Planning</strong></h2>   
        
        <p>There are authors who contest the need for strategic planning of IT due to the intense rate of technological change and the patterns of competition in globalized markets (a matter which will be discussed in the chapter on the New Economy). Some authors, like Ciborra (1998), state the strategic success of IT applications might be achieved through a tentative approach, rather than structured methods of strategic IT planning. These authors argue that frequently the drivers of strategic IT applications are efficiency issues, instead of a result of a strategic IT plan.</p>
        
        <p>Some well-known cases of successful information systems, with clear and recognized strategic impact, do not show evidence of prior planning, which seems to corroborate with this line of thinking as studied by Eardley et al.(1996) </p>
        
        <p>These authors developed a study in which they analyze eight “classics” of strategic systems, whose histories of development, implantation and operation have been sufficiently well documented. The systems studied were the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>American Airlines: Sabre (booking)</li>
            <li>United Airlines: Apollo (booking)</li>
            <li>American Hospital: Asap (Stock and order control)</li>
            <li>Federal Express: Cosmos (Routing/allocation)</li>
            <li>McKesson: Economost (Stock and order control for pharmacies)</li>
            <li>Citicorp: GTN (Negócio Global - Global Trading, global investment management)</li>
            <li>Merrill Lynch: CMA (Integrated Management of Investment Accounts)</li>
            <li>Philadelphia National Bank: MAC (Networks of shared Automatic Teller Machines)</li>
        </ul>   
        <p>To verify why the systems are called strategic, the authors looked for these systems’ impact on each of Porter’s (1979) forces of competition, as shown in Table 5.2.</p>
        <p>Table 5.2. The Impact of ³classic´ cases of strategic information systems on Porter¶s forces of competition (adapted from Eardley et al., 1996)</p>
        <img src="img1%20147.jpg">
        <p>In addition to finding no evidence that the strategic impact of these systems had been previously planned (even though reinforced and exploited intensely after realizing their strategic impact), another significant conclusion was that several of these systems did not pass through the filter of a financial analysis with the data available at the time they were developed.</p>
        
        <h1>Classifying Models that Analyze IT and Strategy</h1>
              
        <p>Over the years, many authors have tried to contribute to the understanding and construction of a process to transform IT into a real strategic tool.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the various publications produced since the end of the 1970s, generally the various models analyzed which deal with the role of IT in organizations can be classified into four groups (Laurindo et al., 2001): </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnostic models:</strong> provide instruments and criteria to diagnose the role of IT in organizations;</li>
            <li><strong>Prescriptive models:</strong> are those that indicate benchmark standards to be followed, or which report the best practices related to the strategic use of IT;</li>
            <li><strong>Models dedicated to action:</strong> indicate procedures for IT planning and for the selection of IT applications to be developed in a way that will have a positive impact on the organizations’ performance;</li>
            <li><strong>Integrative models:</strong> are those that group various elements from the above approaches to form a broader structure of analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Table 5.3 presents some examples of different models of each of the groups above.</p>
        <h>The Issue of Efficiency and Effectiveness: What the Company Should Do</h>
        <p>Throughout this chapter the importance of focusing on the effectiveness of IT utilization has been emphasized, since frequently analysis is done only from the point of view of efficiency. However, this does not mean that being efficient is not positive; it means that one needs to be efficient in certain areas. In other</p>
        <p>Table 5.3. Examples of models for analyzing the strategic role of IT (adapted from Laurindo et al., 2001)</p>
        <img src="img2%20149.png">
        <p>Figure 5.6. Efficiency vs. effectiveness in IT applications (adapted from Laurindo, 2002)</p>
        <img src="img3%20149.jpg">
        <p>words, once effectiveness is achieved, increased efficiency can result in important gains.</p>
        <p>Figure 5.6 contains a proposed diagram for viewing the situations related to efficiency and effectiveness in the use of IT.</p>
        <p>When companies demonstrate low efficiency and high effectiveness, they are in “CHAOS” in a critical situation. The first move to get out of this situation should be to aim at increased effectiveness, and to align the IT strategy with the business strategy.</p><br>If the company has low effectiveness, but high efficiency in the use of IT, it means that it should redirect its efforts, and change the focus of its activities, in order to use its good capacity where it can add value to the company’sompetitiveness.
        <p>In the case of a company with high effectiveness, but low efficiency in IT utilization, it is necessary to work to improve its processes, with a view to exploiting to the maximum the focus that is already on the right things, and which can contribute to the success of the company’s strategy.<br>Finally, a company that is efficient and efficacious in the use of IT will arrive in “Eden”, the ideal situation that should be the goal for all.</p>
        <h2>Seeking the Most Important Points in IT’s Strategic Role</h2>
        <p>Surveying various means of analyzing the strategic role of IT inside the organizations points to the growing complexity of the issue, in response to the increased strategic opportunities opened up by IT. Today, business and IT strategies are often confused, especially with companies active on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Even though a large number of articles are devoted to analyzing the relationship between IT and company strategy, this theme remains a fertile field for more research, due to the dynamism of IT potentialities and to the new strategies for the market.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to list some points that allow for diverse approaches and which therefore merit emphasis in IT use in alignment with business strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The need to have a clear strategic vision for both business and IT, to view IT as a competitive advantage for the business, and that it be dedicated to the market and to the IT user.</li>
            <p>Having a clear strategic vision for business and for IT is the starting point for making a significant impact on the organization’s performance. IT needs to be seen as a means for the company to obtain competitive advantages in the market. It needs to act in concert with the company’s operations and strategy. Technological advances in themselves are not justified without this vision.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>• Competitive advantage resulting from IT management and its strategic alignment with the business and not from specific applications of IT.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Various authors (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993; Luftman et al., 1993; Rockart et al., 1996; Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Luftman, 1996; Avison et al., 1998) argue that it is not enough to have an IT strategy, it has to be aligned with the business strategy of the company. Further, there is a notion that this alignment should be developed and maintained over time in a dynamic process. It is not possible to maintain a competitive advantage with a specific IT application since it is increasingly easy to copy this application and an increasing number of companies use common software, such as, for example, ERP systems (Laurindo et al., 2002). Only an advantage based on IT management aligned with the business permits companies to maintain an advantage for a longer time.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>• The importance of considering all the technical (including monitoring the evolution of what is available in the IT market) as well as the organizational aspects.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) stress, it is necessary for organizations to pay attention to what is newly available in the IT market and that there exist integration between its strategies and structures, both of IT and the business.></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>• Seeking effectiveness and not just efficiency.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <P>Even though it is recognized that there is a need for efficiency and high technical capacity in IT operations, it is consensus that a company will only be able to obtain competitive advantages by procuring effectiveness in the use of IT as well. The search for IT effectiveness means analyzing its impact on the results the company obtains, as well as considering gains in productivity and the competitiveness of the business as measures of IT effectiveness.</P>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>• The need for a close and intense relationship between the executives of the IT and business areas</strong></li></ul>
            
            <p>One of the most cited manners for obtaining strategic IT applications is the existence of a good relationship between executives from the IT and business areas. This means that there exist structures and procedures aimed at strengthening and ensuring the continuity of this good relationship. In companies where IT has or is beginning to have a strategic role for the business, the closeness of IT and business executives in the hierarchy takes on greater importance (Li & Ye, 1999; Prairie, 1996; Rockart et al., 1996; McFarlan, 1990; Willcocks & Lester, 1997; Earl & Feeny, 1994) In addition there should be the realization that it is not a matter just for technicians, but is an issue to be considered throughout the organization, and especially by those who formulate and decide business strategy. In turn, the IT executives should develop abilities in addition to technology management; they also need to have a clear vision of the business.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>• Variable evaluation criteria according to the application.</strong></li></ul>
        <p>Given the many different strategies for business and IT, as well as the different importance of IT in each organization, IT should be evaluated based on several criteria (encompassing the technical, organizational, and strategic aspects) and adapted to each company. Thus adopting a single standard for evaluating the effectiveness of IT is not viable.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>• Dynamic and flexible management of IT (as a continuous process) and of its evaluation.</strong></li></ul>
        <p>IT management (its strategy and planning) must be a continuous process, not restricted to the “moment of planning”, but monitoring IT throughout its life cycle. IT management should also be flexible enough to monitor outside changes in terms of opportunities for business strategies and the availability of IT.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>• The issue of the “productivity paradox.”</strong></li></ul>
        <p>The debate about whether productivity gains do result from IT still hovers in the air; therefore, analyses to explain or deny it are becoming progressively broader.<br>Productivity indicators (measures) for IT cannot be based solely on technical and efficiency aspects; they must be connected to business productivity measures that truly represent what is significant for the company’s progress.</p>
        <h2><strong>Trends in the Strategic Role of IT</strong></h2>
        <p>Researches had been developed in order to find the enablers of Strategic Alignment. Luftman (2001) listed five of them: senior executive support for IT, IT involved in strategy development, IT understands the business, business-IT partnership, well-prioritized IT projects, and IT demonstrates leadership. The absence or poor performance of these same factors is considered an inhibitor of Strategic Alignment.</p>
        <p>Some authors, like Ciborra (1998), state the strategic success of IT applications might be achieved through a tentative approach, rather than structured methods of strategic IT planning. These authors argue that frequently the drivers of strategic IT applications are efficiency issues, instead of a result of a strategic IT plan. Some important and well-known successful information systems, with clear strategic impacts, do not present evidences of being previously planned, what seems to be in agreement with this kind of thinking (Eardley et al., 1996).</p>
        <p>What does the future hold for the role of IT in the strategy of organizations? At present there are a series of applications that have captivated the attention of many and have opened up new possibilities, just as there are new concerns. Terms such as Knowledge Management and CRM (Customer Relationship Management), have been much used and are strongly associated to IT. In fact, without IT these concepts have difficulty becoming resources effectively used in companies.</p>
        <p>Despite the failure of many virtual enterprises (the so-called “dot.coms”), ebusiness and e-commerce applications appear to have reached a new level of maturity, especially B2B (business-to-business — the connection between companies via internet).</p>
        <p>There are various success stories and large companies are increasingly investing in this success. According to Porter (2001), the Internet is the IT tool that, up to the present, has shown the greatest potential of being a factor in obtaining strategic advantages. This matter is explored in the chapter on the New Economy</p>
        <p>Within this scenario, an appropriate analysis and evaluation of IT effectiveness can take on a fundamental role, enabling it to really become a powerful tool for competitiveness.</p>
        <h1>Case Studies: Strategy and
            Decisions in Perspective</h1>
        <h2><strong>Case – IT is Worth its Weight in Results</strong></h2>
        <p>According to the 2003 reports from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, software sales in the United States rose just 6% in 2002, after a drop of 3% in 2001. For the Gartner Group, which researches the IT sector, a 4.9% increase in demand for products and services for this sector was predicted for 2003, but the majority of expenditures in new projects will only take place if a return on these investments can be demonstrated. </p>
        <p>In this analysis of investments in IT, these studies shows that companies use financial indicators such as the ROI (return on investment) and TCO (total cost of ownership). In a simplified way, the ROI measures financial returns on investments undertaken, while the TCO lists the direct and indirect costs of a product or service. However, calculating these indicators for IT projects is not an easy task.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a study of large companies in Brazil by the Grupo IT Mídia, indicated that 59% of the executives declared their intention to increase investment in IT in 2003. But 46% of the amounts that will be applied include the intention to realize immediate returns.</p>
        <p>For example, Ásia Shipping, which is in the business of marine freight transportation, invested R$250 thousand between 2001 and 2002 to modernize its IT infrastructure, and significantly reduced its costs. Among the IT applications were rapid connections via Internet of its offices in São Paulo, Santos (SP), Paranaguá (PR), and Vitória (ES) and the ability of clients to monitor their shipments.</p>
        <p>Another example is the adoption by Siemen’s Brazilian affiliate of a single standard operational system to facilitate technical support involved an investment of R$3 million, which was paid off in one year of operation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Industil, a paint manufacturing industry in the eastern region of the city of São Paulo, invested R$35 thousand to install rapid Internet and e-mail accounts for its employees and a new network, and experienced large cost reductions with improvements in the security of data critical to the company and the elimination of paper correspondence.
        Portal Agência Estado, February 17, 2003</p>
        <h><strong>Case – Between Trucks and Refrigerators, Computers</strong></h>
        <p>Casas Bahia, the major retail outlet for household appliances in Brazil, is known for selling at low prices to a low-income public and for not being on the Internet; the site only provides general information such as store addresses and contains nothing of electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>However, within its culture of divestment and pragmatism, IT has guaranteed its place in the company and the results have been very positive. And both the space and the results are appreciable. One indication is the fact that Casas Bahia is one of the three largest among IBM’s retail and consumer goods clients.</p>
        <p>An integrated management system allows the company managers to accompany daily sales by type of product and daily invoicing by store. Until now, the lack of the Internet has been premeditated and is due to the fact that its lowincome clients do not have Internet access.</p>
        <p>However, since credit service is the key to its operations since sales on credit make up 90% of the total, Casas Bahia has invested in a complex and sophisticated system of business intelligence which can analyze the company’s database to find patterns not evident at first glance. This is a new and expensive technology that incorporates elements of artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>In this way, clients with a higher probability for payment default (about 6% of annual billing of 3.6 billion reais in 2001) can be identified.</p>
        <p>Significant investments (around 7 million reais) were made in modernizing the data network. With this, all the stores and warehouses became linked to an intranet that transmits both voice and data traffic six times quicker.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this network, management can monitor all the company’s operations from its headquarters in São Caetano do Sul, in the ABC region of São Paulo.</p>
        <p>Another critical point where IT has made an important contribution is to logistics. In 1995, an enormous investment was made in a gigantic 170 thousand square meter distribution center in Jundiaí, São Paulo where more than 1.2 million items from eight states arrived, destined to 24,000 different addresses. The IT logistical system is integrated into the purchasing and sales system and product entry and exit is controlled by bar code. The extension of integration from sales to delivery is contemplated. Once the sale is concluded, this system allows merchandise to be located in the warehouse and cleared, and the truck route to deliver the product is elaborated automatically. Thus the client can be informed of the exact delivery date at the time of purchase.</p> </div>
